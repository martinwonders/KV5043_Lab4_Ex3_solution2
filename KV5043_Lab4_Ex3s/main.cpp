	//3) ToDo: Create a C++ string namd fileContents
	
	
	//4) ToDo: Create a const C++ string named fileName and assign it a literal string to match the fileName
	

	//5) ToDo: Call the readFromFile function using the fileName and fileContents strings
	

	//6) ToDo: Create a stringstream object named sStream using the fileContents string
	

	//7) ToDo: Create a string variable to store a line of text name it line
	
	
	//8) ToDo: Create a string array named tokens with 6 elements (Why 6? check the windowParameters.txt file)
	//The first field is the name of the object the remaining fields are the attributes of the object
	

	//9) ToDo: Get a line from the sStream using getline(stringstream, string) 
	// this line is the window with the parameters check the windowParameters.txt file
	

	//10) ToDo: Use your splitString(const std::string& str, char delimiter, std::string result[], const int arraySize);

											//15) ToDo: use an element in the array that represents the width (Note: we are trying to store a string in a float);
											//16) ToDo: use an element in the array that represents the height (Note: we are trying to store a string in a float);
			
			//This next line creates a user defined data type (struct) Rectangle (we will discuss these in week 7). 
			// We are using the data read in from the file.
